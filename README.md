# fontawesome-5-cheatsheet
PHP Cheetsheet for lookups.

## What it do?
it does scrape cheatsheet from [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/cheatsheet/pro/) vary wel

## But how I do?
you do by make sure it update and run
`\lachee\fontawesome\Cheatsheet::fromName('discord')`
This will return an icon object that contains shit.

If it doesn't update, you may need to initially use `\lachee\fontawesome\Updater::update()` first.

## Is it legal?
¯\_(ツ)_/¯

## wat about composer
`composer require lachee/fontawesome-5-cheatsheet`
You may need to tell explicitly to use the @dev
